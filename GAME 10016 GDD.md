# GAME 10016 GDD | "Portalception" 
Made by: **Chris Short, Parker Hamilton, Ethan Koocher**

# Game Mechanic | Portals   
3D puzzle platformer that utilizes portals to solve challenges or assist with player movement. Portals can be placed by the player on any wall they can view. Players will enter a "aim mode" and be able to place a portal on where their crosshair is positioned.

# Objective Statement
 To create a prototype that explores how the mechanics of portal-based movement can challenge player's problem solving skills in a 3rd person perspective.
 
 **Key Question:** In what ways do dynamic portal mechanics affect player strategy and decision-making when problem solving?

**Why?:** Understanding the impact of portal mechanics on player experience is crucial for designing engaging levels and puzzles. By prototyping different interactive elements, we aim to discover what combinations best challenge players while maintaining a sense of flow and satisfaction. This process will develop the overall design, ensuring the final product is not only entertaining but also suits the game mechanic effectively.

# Design Rationale  

## Experience #1 | Navigation
Players will explore their environment by navigating through portals that transport them to any locations throughout the game world. This teleportation mechanic allows for adaptive movement and encourages players to experiment with their surroundings.
### Innovation:
The goal is to achieve a sense of discovery and exploration. By designing specific areas of the map that can only be accessed through the use of portals, players will experiment by uncovering new and previously unreachable locations, enhancing their engagement and curiosity as they progress through the game.

## Experience #2 | 3rd Person Camera
As a third-person game, the camera perspective grants players the ability to explore their environment from a wider viewpoint. This perspective is essential for engaging with various puzzles scattered throughout the game, players will engage with their spatial awareness to see their surroundings and calculate solutions for challenges. 
### Innovation:
This perspective aids players in visualizing their portal placements, making it easier for them to strategize their approach to each puzzle. Players can more effectively plan their routes and consider how to utilize portals to problem solve, ultimately leading to a more engaging and rewarding gameplay experience.

## Experience #3 | Objects
Portals can also be utilized to teleport various objects in the game world. For example, players may encounter a challenge where they need to successfully place a specific number of objects into a box in order to unlock a door and progress further in the game. Players must not only navigate their own movements but also manipulate the environment around them to achieve their objectives. 
### Innovation:
This ability to teleport objects through portals enhances the potential for dynamic interactions in puzzle design. It encourages players to think creatively about the various applications of portal mechanics beyond simple movement. By considering how to utilize portals for object manipulation, players will engage in strategic planning and problem-solving, leading to a richer gameplay experience.
